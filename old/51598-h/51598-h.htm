<h2>Stratford Impressions</h2>

</div>

<p>It is the everlasting glory of Stratford-upon-Avon
that it was the birthplace of Shakespeare. Situated
in the heart of beautiful Warwickshire, it nestles cosily
in an atmosphere of tranquil loveliness, and it is surrounded
by everything that gentle rural scenery can provide
to soothe the mind and to nurture contentment. It
stands upon a plain, almost in the center of England,
through which, between low green hills that roll away on
either side, the Avon flows, in many capricious windings,
to the Severn, and so to the sea.</p>

</div>

<p>The golden glory of the setting sun burns on the
gray spire of Stratford church, and on the ancient
graveyard below,&mdash;wherein the mossy stones lean
this way and that, in sweet and orderly confusion,&mdash;and
on the peaceful avenue of limes, and on the burnished
water of silver Avon. The tall, pointed, many-colored
windows of the church glint in the evening light. A cool,
fragrant wind is stirring the branches and the grass. The
songbirds, calling to their mates or sporting in the wanton
pleasure of their airy life, are circling over the church
roof or hiding in little crevices of its walls. On the vacant
meadows across the river stretch away the long, level
shadows of the stately elms.</p>

<h2>WARWICK CASTLE</h2>

<p class="center">Monograph Number One in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-fancy-n.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">No one should come abruptly upon Stratford, the home of
Shakespeare, as Mr. Winter says. It is wiser and pleasanter
to approach it gradually by way of Warwick and
Kenilworth. Both these castles have a place in Shakespeare’s
plays, and it is well worth while for the visitor to see them.</p>

<p>Warwick is a quaint old town. Its population is about 12,000, and
it lies on a hill rising from the river Avon. Far back in antiquity it
was a settlement of the Britons, and, afterward, it was occupied by
the Romans. Its present name is of Saxon origin. Many of the houses
retain their medieval appearance; and in fact two of the old gates of
the town are still standing.</p>

<p>The prevailing quality of the town of Warwick is a sweet, solemn
peace. The people live there as in a gentle dream of repose. The little
rows of cottages breathe contentment; ivy embowers them, and roses
cluster about their windows.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Mary at Warwick as it now stands was rebuilt
after a fire in 1694. The Lord Leicester Hospital was established by
Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in 1571. He founded it for the
reception of twelve poor men. This building contains several interesting
relics, one of which is a Saxon chair said to be a thousand years old; and
another is a piece of needle-work by Amy Robsart, the heroine of Sir
Walter Scott’s novel, “Kenilworth.”</p>

<p>On a commanding position overlooking the Avon rises Warwick
Castle, the ancient and stately home of the Earls of Warwick. This
castle is one of the finest and most picturesque feudal residences in England.
It probably dates from Saxon times; but the oldest part now standing
is the tall Cæsar’s Tower, 147 feet high, which was probably built
soon after the Norman conquest. In 1871 a great fire almost completely
destroyed the castle; but it was restored in the old style. The most
important event in the history of the building was its successful defence
by the Parliamentarians during the Civil War in England.</p>

<p>The interior of the castle contains an interesting collection of paintings,
old armor, and other curiosities. In the Great Hall are the sword
and some other relics of the legendary Count Guy of Warwick. His
feats of arms in slaying terrible monsters are an important part of English
legend. In the Great Hall also are the mace of Richard Neville, Earl
of Warwick, who was known as “the king maker,” and the helmet of
Oliver Cromwell. This castle is noted for its famous collection of pictures,
among which are several by Rubens and Van Dyck. In the
conservatory of the castle is preserved the famous Warwick vase of marble,
which was found near Hadrian’s Villa at Tivoli, in Italy, and is
attributed to the fourth century B. C.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne has put into words the very feeling that comes
over each visitor to Warwick: “We can scarcely think the scene real,
so completely do those towers, the long line of battlements, the massive
buttresses, the high-windowed walls, shape out our indistinct ideas of
the antique time.”</p>

<h2>KENILWORTH CASTLE</h2>

<p class="center">Monograph Number Two in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-fancy-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It was in 1575 at Kenilworth Castle that the Earl of Leicester,
then a suitor for the hand of Queen Elizabeth, entertained
her and the court at “excessive cost” as described in “Kenilworth,”
by Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>Everyone who has read the book knows that the Earl of
Leicester had secretly married Amy Robsart, the daughter of a country
gentleman, and at the same time was attempting to gain the favor of
Elizabeth. When a disclosure of the truth was about to precipitate the
ruin of Leicester, he prepared a magnificent pageant at his castle for the
Queen; in the meanwhile his follower, Varney, was to pass himself off
as Amy’s husband.</p>

<p>At Kenilworth Castle, on the Queen’s first entry, “a small floating
island illuminated by a great variety of torches … made its appearance
upon the lake,” upon which, clad in silks, were the Lady of the Lake and
two nymphs waiting on her. During the several days of the Queen’s
stay “rare shews and sports were exercised.”</p>

<p>The town of Kenilworth has a population of only about 5,000. The
magnificent old castle is now in ruins. It was originally founded about
1120. In the 13th century it passed into the hands of Simon de Montfort.
Some years later it came to John of Gaunt. Later the castle
became royal property, and in 1562 Queen Elizabeth presented it to the
Earl of Leicester. He spent enormous sums of money in enlarging and
improving the building. At his death, however, it passed back into the
possession of the Crown. When Cromwell became Ruler of England he
gave the castle to some of his officers, who demolished the stately pile
for the sake of its materials. After the Restoration it passed into the
hands of the Earl of Clarendon, who still retains it. One of the principal
parts of the building remaining is Leicester’s gatehouse, now occupied as a
private dwelling. Then there is also the Norman Keep of Cæsar’s
Tower. This has massive walls fifteen or sixteen feet thick. Merwyn’s
Tower, built by John of Gaunt about 1392, may also be seen: the “small
octangular chamber” on its second floor is the one assigned by Walter
Scott to Amy Robsart.</p>

<h2>CHARLECOTE</h2>

<p class="center">Monograph Number Three in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-fancy-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The well-known tale of Shakespeare’s poaching on the preserves
of Sir Thomas Lucy and his subsequent punishment
is doubted by many authorities; yet this story has clung
to the poet and has always been associated with the house
of Charlecote.</p>

<p>The legend runs that Shakespeare as a gay and heedless youth stole
deer from the park at Charlecote. The fact of the matter is that
there were no deer at Charlecote at the time; but there was a warren,
and this term legally covers a preserve for other animals than
hares or rabbits. At any rate, the young poet is said to have been
called up before Sir Thomas Lucy, who was then sheriff, and prosecuted
in 1585. There is added the statement that Shakespeare aggravated
the offence by writing a silly ballad on Sir Thomas and affixing it to his
gate. This gave the Knight great offence, and Shakespeare is said to
have been driven from Stratford to London. The ballad, however, is
probably a forgery.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is generally supposed to have caricatured Sir Thomas
Lucy in his portrait of Justice Shallow in the second part of “Henry
IV,” and in the “Merry Wives of Windsor.” This may be true for,
in the coat-of-arms of Lucy there were three “luces”; while Slender remarks
of Robert Shallow that “the ancestors who come after him may
give the dozen white luces in their coat.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Lucy was born on April 24, 1532. Three of his ancestors
had been sheriffs of Warwickshire and Leicestershire: and on his father’s
death in 1552 Thomas inherited the estates of Sherborne and Hampton
Lucy, in addition to Charlecote, which was rebuilt for him by John of
Padua in about 1558. In 1565 he was knighted and a few years later he
became high sheriff of the county.</p>

<p>In 1558 Sir Thomas Lucy introduced into Parliament a bill for the
better preservation of game and grain; this, together with his reputation
as a preserver of game, gives some color to the Shakespearian tradition
connected with his name. He died at Charlecote on July 7, 1600.
The Charlecote estates eventually passed to the Rev. John Hammond
through his marriage with Alice Lucy, and in 1789 he himself adopted
the name of Lucy.</p>

<p>Charlecote is still occupied by one of his descendants. It contains a
good collection of old paintings, antique furniture, and many objects of
Shakespearian interest. The park is now well stocked with deer.</p>

<p>Charlecote Church, nearby, contains several monuments of the Lucy
family, including one to the wife of Sir Thomas Lucy with a fine epitaph
written by the Knight himself. This epitaph shows that Sheriff Lucy
could hardly have been otherwise than kind and gentle. He may
have been a severe magistrate and perhaps a haughty, disagreeable
neighbor, but in those lines there is a tone of manhood and high feeling
that wins a prompt response of sympathy. If Shakespeare stole the
deer of Sir Thomas Lucy, he received just punishment and the Knight
was not to blame.</p>

<h2>THE CHURCH AND THE RIVER, STRATFORD-UPON-AVON</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Historians may deny it, statisticians may disprove it, yet
Stratford is the heart of England, and the little Avon is in
a sense the most famous of all English rivers. It is the goal
of all Shakespeare lovers. The poet and the river are Stratford’s
two claims for distinction&mdash;but what place could ask
for more? The Avon gives it a setting, the beauty of which can never
entirely pass from the mind of the beholder; Shakespeare, the man
and the poet, is to be seen and heard everywhere.</p>

<p>Stratford-upon-Avon is a clean and well built little country town of
about 8,000 or 9,000 inhabitants. It has wide and pleasant streets with
numerous quaint half-timbered houses. It is a place of great antiquity.
Stratford is mentioned in a Saxon Charter of the eighth century, and
Roman coins have been found in the district showing that it was inhabited
in Roman times. Later it had some importance as an agricultural center.
In addition to this, the various trades of weaving, glove-making,
candle-making, and soap-making were carried on; but now these have
lost their importance, and the town owes its fame almost entirely to the
memory of Shakespeare, born there in 1564. Over 35,000 pilgrims annually
visit Stratford.</p>

<p>The River Avon, gently flowing among meadows and forests, is
navigable only for small boats. At Stratford it is crossed by a stone
bridge of fourteen arches. This was built by Sir Hugh Clopton in the
reign of Henry VII.</p>

<p>On the bank of the river is the Church of the Holy Trinity. It
occupies the site of a Saxon monastery, and was probably completed in
the fifteenth century. It was greatly restored in 1890-1892 and 1898.
The central tower dates probably from the twelfth century. This is
surmounted by a lofty spire.</p>

<p>The interior of the church contains many things of interest, but
those that attract the visitor most strongly are, of course, the ones connected
with Shakespeare. There is his grave, and there on the wall
above is the bust which was executed soon after his death. The stained
glass window nearby, representing the Seven Ages, was erected with the
contributions of American visitors. Near Shakespeare’s tomb are those
of his wife, Anne Hathaway, of his daughter and son-in-law, and of
Thomas Nash, the first husband of his granddaughter, Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Shakespeare’s House, in which the poet was born in 1564, is now
national property.</p>

<p>The Shakespeare Memorial Building, the site for which was presented
to the town of Stratford by Charles Edward Flower, stands on
the banks of the Avon a little above Trinity Church. It was erected
in 1879. It includes a Theater in which annual performances are held
in April, and occasional performances during the winter. The “Droeshout
Portrait” of Shakespeare, an authentic portrait of the dramatist,
is one of the treasures kept in this building. In the adjoining grounds
is the Shakespeare Monument presented in 1888 by the sculptor Lord
Ronald Gower. On top of the Monument is a large seated figure of the
poet, and around the base are figures of Lady Macbeth, Prince Hal,
Falstaff, and Hamlet.</p>

<p>The Red Horse Hotel in Stratford contains a bedroom and a sitting-room
occupied by Washington Irving. There may still be seen the
chair in which he sat and the poker with which he meditatively stirred
the fire.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The earliest record of the house in which Shakespeare died
at Stratford is contained in these words of a visitor there
in 1760:</p>

<p>“There stood here till lately the house in which Shakespeare
lived, and a mulberry-tree of his planting; the house
was large, strong and handsome; the tree so large that it would shade
the grass-plot in your garden, which I think is more than twenty yards
square, and supply the whole town with mulberries every year. As the
curiosity of this house and tree brought much fame, and more company
and profit, to the town, a certain man, on some disgust, has pulled the
house down, so as not to leave one stone upon another, and cut the tree,
and piled it as a stack of firewood, to the great vexation, loss, and disappointment
of the inhabitants; however, an honest silversmith bought
the whole stack of wood, and makes many odd things of this wood for
the curious, some of which I hope to bring with me to town.”</p>

<p>The “certain man” who pulled the house down was the Reverend
Francis Gastrell. Shakespeare bought New Place in 1597. It had
been built by Sir Hugh Clopton in 1483. After Shakespeare went to
live in it we can imagine him standing in his garden and watching the
boys with their “shining morning faces” going to the school nearby.
Now, however, nothing remains but the foundation of the house.</p>

<p>Shakespeare died there on April 23, 1616. He left the house to his
daughter, Susan Hall. She lived there until 1649, and her daughter in
turn kept it until 1670. In 1753 it came into the possession of the Reverend
Francis Gastrell. Visitors annoyed him so much that he cut
down the poet’s mulberry-tree that grew in the garden, and later razed
the house to the ground. The site was purchased by money raised
through public subscription and presented to the trustees of Shakespeare’s
birthplace in 1870. Only the foundations are now visible, covered
over by wire. The great garden at the back is now a public garden,
and in it on the central lawn is a mulberry-tree, descended from the
poet’s own tree.</p>

<p>Next to New Place is the house of Shakespeare’s grandson by marriage,
Thomas Nash. It has been restored so as to give it the appearance
it had in Shakespeare’s day. Thomas Nash was married to Elizabeth
Hall, Shakespeare’s only granddaughter and last surviving descendant.</p>

<p>Opposite New Place stands the Guild Chapel. This is externally
much the same as in the poet’s day. It is adjoined by the old Guild
Hall, where Shakespeare may often have seen the performances of strolling
players. The upper story is the Grammar School in which he was
educated.</p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE OF SHOTTERY</h2>

<p class="center">Monograph Number Six in The Mentor Reading Course</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-fancy-t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Tradition has always fixed the house known as Anne Hathaway’s
Cottage in Shottery as the house where Shakespeare
wooed and won his bride. There is no doubt that the house
belonged to a family named Hathaway, but whether to those
from whom Anne sprang cannot be said with certainty.</p>

<p>The village of Shottery is about one mile from Stratford. It is a
prosperous little town with one or two industries and many substantial
cottages. Anne Hathaway’s Cottage stands on the outskirts. It is a
rather large building of the Elizabethan period and was once a farmhouse.
It stands today practically as it was in Shakespeare’s time. In
front of the cottage is a small garden gay with old-fashioned flowers.</p>

<p>The house itself is built of wood and plaster and covered with a
thatched roof. The interior is low-ceilinged; and the main room has a
stone floor and wide fireplace with cozy chimney corner. The house
contains an old wooden settle on which Shakespeare may often have sat,
a carved bedstead, and other relics of three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>A bedroom which is said to have been that of Anne Hathaway, has
a sloping roof and contains some old pottery, chairs, and tables.</p>

<p>Anne Hathaway’s Cottage was purchased for the British nation in
1892 at a cost of about $15,000. It is now cared for by the “Shakespeare
Birthplace Trust.”</p>

<p>The Hathaways had lived in Shottery for forty years prior to Shakespeare’s
marriage. At this time the poet was just eighteen, while Anne
herself was nearly twenty-six. They were married in November, 1582.</p>

<p>It is not known exactly where Shakespeare and his wife lived during
the first years after their marriage. However, in 1585 he was obliged
to leave his wife and children and go to London to seek his fortune. It
is probable that Anne then returned beneath her parents’ roof. No
one can look upon this humble cottage without a thrill as he realizes
that the garret of the cottage in Shottery may often have welcomed
the poet when he came home from his labors in the great city.</p>

<p>The Shakespeare<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Country, Warwickshire, is situated nearly in the
center of England, and the birthplace of Shakespeare, Stratford-upon-Avon,
is situated in the southern part of Warwickshire. A
pleasant way in which to enter the Shakespeare Country is to travel by
rail from London to Warwick, and then drive from Warwick to Stratford.
There are two roads for the drive, one twelve miles long, the other eight.
Both are agreeable; but the longer is the better, because more can be
seen by the way. The traveler is wise who lodges for a few days at Warwick,
in order to visit Warwick Castle, St. Mary’s Church, the ancient
Gates, and the hospital for twelve aged men founded in 1571 by Queen
Elizabeth’s favorite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (the scene of Hawthorne’s
singular posthumous romance, “Dr. Grimshawe’s Secret”), and
incidentally to make excursions northward to Kenilworth and Coventry.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span
class="label">[1]</span></a> There are 4,000 variations in the spelling
of the name “Shakespeare.” An entire book has been made up on the
subject.</p>

</div>

<p>All those places, in themselves interesting, are associated with the
Shakespeare Story, and a view of them gradually imparts to the observer’s
mind a sympathetic comprehension of the environment in which
Shakespeare was born and reared. The face of the country has, of course,
been changed since his time, because little villages, fine villas, fertile
farms, spacious parks, and blooming meadows now exist where once there
was a woodland called the Forest of Arden (the indubitable forest, memories
of which colored Shakespeare’s fancy when he wrote “As You Like
It”), extending for many miles northward and westward from a point
near Stratford and along the river Avon. Some things survive, however,
which can be seen much as the poet saw them more than 300 years ago.</p>

<h3>KENILWORTH AND WARWICK</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus16b.jpg" width="300" height="216" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE MILL, GUY’S CLIFF NEAR WARWICK</p>

<p class="caption">The name is derived from Guy, Earl of Warwick, who once
lived as a hermit, in a cave below the house, and was
buried there</p>

</div>

<p>When Shakespeare saw Kenilworth Castle he did not, indeed, see it as
it now is, a picturesque mass of ruins,&mdash;the wreck made by Cromwell’s
soldiers about 1643-45,&mdash;but as a stately structure, at once a fortress
and a palace. Warwick Castle, on the contrary, was the same imposing
structure to him that it is to the observer of today. In the modern
part of that castle now the visitor is shown a sumptuous collection of
paintings, including Van Dyck’s famous equestrian portrait of King
Charles I, and such suggestive relics as the helmet and the death-mask of
Cromwell; but those things impress the mind much less than does the
building itself. That Shakespeare entered the Castle is not known; but
that he saw it cannot be doubted, for Cæsar’s Tower&mdash;one of the older
parts of it&mdash;which dominates the region around Warwick now has been
grandly conspicuous there for more than 400 years, and in the poet’s
time it must have been familiar to all inhabitants of Warwickshire. Kenilworth,
Coventry, and Warwick figure in some of his historical plays,
and his particular knowledge of all the surroundings of Stratford, and,
indeed, of the whole of central England, through which the Wars of the
Roses raged, is manifested in
those dramas. He had ample
opportunity of acquiring that
knowledge.</p>

<p>The first twenty-one or
twenty-two years of his life
were passed by him in his
native town. The next twenty-seven
years he passed in
London, visiting Stratford once
a year. In his closing years,
from about 1613 to his death
in 1616, he dwelt in Stratford,
in his house called New Place,
bought by him in 1597, where
he died. The traveler who
visits the Shakespeare Country,
viewing it exclusively with
reference to its associations
with the poet, should bear in
mind these divisions of time.
The larger part of Shakespeare’s
work was done in London.
It is mostly as a youth,
though a little as a veteran,
that personally he is connected
with Stratford.</p>

<h3>BLACKLOW HILL AND
GUY’S CLIFF</h3>

<p>In the course of the drive
from Warwick to Stratford
(either way) the traveler
passes Ganerslie Heath and
Blacklow Hill, places said to
be haunted. On Blacklow Hill
the corrupt Piers Gaveston,
Earl of Cornwall, unworthy
favorite of that weak king,
Edward II, was beheaded,
June 20, 1312, by order of
Guy, tenth Earl of Warwick,
whom he had opposed and
maligned, calling him “the Black Dog of Arden,” and some of the
peasantry of the neighborhood entertain to this day an old superstitious
notion that dismal bells have been heard to toll from that hill at
midnight. The scene of Gaveston’s decapitation is marked by a monument.
Another place of interest to be seen in the course of the drive
is Guy’s Cliff, a secluded residence, beside the Avon, traditionally associated
with an ancient, fabled Guy, Earl of Warwick, who, after performing
prodigies of valor, retired to that place and lived and died a hermit.
Camden, the antiquary, Shakespeare’s contemporary, whose “Britannia”
(1586) he probably knew, thus happily describes it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There have ye a shady little wood, cleere and cristall springs, mossy
bottomes and caves, medowes alwaies fresh and greene, the river rumbling
here and there among the stones with his streame making a mild noise and
gentle whispering, and besides all this, solitary and still quietnesse, things
most grateful to the Muses.”</p>

<h3>THE BEAUTY OF
SHAKESPEARE’S
COUNTRY</h3>

<p>Those quaint words
convey a just impression
of the beauty of the
Shakespeare Country. Its
physical aspects are charming;
its inhabitants and
its products are characteristic;
its historic associations
are diversified and
impressive. It is entirely
worth seeing for its own sake, and it richly rewards the visitor who explores
it in a sympathetic spirit and a leisurely way. But the great glory of
Warwickshire consists in the fact that it was the birthplace of Shakespeare;
the scene of all his youthful experience, his education, his courtship of
Anne Hathaway (whose dwelling yet remains), his marriage, the birth of
his three children, his death, and his burial.</p>

<p class="caption">A ROOM

SCHOOL,

</div>

<p>I could never forget the emotion with which my mind was thrilled
when first I took the drive from Warwick to Stratford (1877), and alighted
at the old Red Horse Hotel. The day had been one of exceptional
beauty. The long twilight had faded, and the stars were shining when
that night, for the first time, I stood at the door of the birthplace of
Shakespeare, and looked on its quaint casements and gables, its antique
porch, and the massive timbers that cross its front. I conjure up the
vision now, as I saw it then. I stand there for a long while, and feel that
I shall remember these sights forever. Then, with lingering steps, I turn
away, and, passing through a narrow, crooked lane, I walk in the High
Street, and note at the end of the prospect the illuminated clock in a
dark church-tower. A few chance-directed steps bring me to what was
New Place once, where Shakespeare died, and there again I pause and
long remain in meditation, gazing into the inclosed garden, where, under
screens of wire, are fragments of mortar and stone. These&mdash;although I
do not know it&mdash;are the remains of the foundations of Shakespeare’s
house. The night wanes, but still I walk in Stratford streets, and by and
by I am standing on the bridge that spans the Avon, and looking down
at the thick-clustered stars reflected in the dark and silent stream. At
last, under the roof of the Red Horse, I sink into a troubled slumber,
from which soon a strain of celestial music, strong, sweet, jubilant, and
splendid, awakens me in an instant, and I start up in bed,&mdash;to find that
all around me is as still as death; and then, drowsily, far off, the bell strikes
three, in that weird, grim, lonesome church-tower which I have just seen.</p>

<h3>THE RED HORSE HOTEL</h3>

<p>Many times since that first night at Stratford I have rested in the
old Red Horse, and nowhere, in a large experience of travel, have I found
a more homelike abode. It is a storied dwelling, too; for it was an inn
when Shakespeare lived. It is believed to have been known to those old
poets Michael Drayton and Ben Jonson; Betterton is said to have lodged
in it when he visited Stratford, to glean information about the great
dramatist of whose chief characters his age esteemed him the supremely
best interpreter; Garrick knew the house when he was in Stratford in
1769 to conduct the Shakespeare Jubilee; and in later years it has harbored
scores of renowned persons from every part of the world. Washington
Irving, revered as the father of American literature, was a lodger
there in 1817, and wrote about it in his companionable “Sketch Book,”
and the parlor that he then occupied has ever since borne his name and
been embellished with picture and relic commemorative of his visit. The
pilgrim loses much benefit and pleasure by carelessly speeding through
the Shakespeare Country, as many excursionists do. It is far better to
repose in the Red Horse, or some other cozy retreat, and spend many days
in rambling about the neighborhood. To the lover of the works of Shakespeare
the experience is one of the most profitable that life affords.</p>

<h3>STONELEIGH AND CHARLECOTE</h3>

<p>In driving from Warwick to Stratford the traveler obtains a distant
glimpse of Stoneleigh Abbey, one of the fine baronial homes of England,
the residence of Lord Leigh, and at a certain stile, near Charlecote House,
the carriage is halted, so that the spacious park of Charlecote can be
crossed on foot by a passenger who may wish to see the place where, as
legend has long affirmed, Shakespeare killed the deer of Sir Thomas
Lucy, thereby incurring enmity and punishment. The story lacks proof.
No deer were kept by Sir Thomas at Charlecote,&mdash;though now they are
numerous there,&mdash;but they were kept by him at Fullbrook, a park that
he owned, not very far from Charlecote, and it is not impossible that
Shakespeare and his comrades, in the wildness of frolicsome youth, did
poach upon his preserves. Tradition, in all old English country places,
has, when tested, often been found entirely worthy of credence.</p>

<h3>STRATFORD OLD AND NEW</h3>

<p>The Stratford of the sixteenth century, though then nearly 300
years old, was merely a village. The houses were chiefly of the one-story
kind, made of timber. The inhabitants were in number about
1,400: indeed, the whole population of England was not so numerous as
that of London is now. If Shakespeare could revisit his old haunts,
though he would see the same green, rose-decked, and poppy-spangled
countryside that once he
knew, and hear the ripple
of the Avon softly flowing
between its grassy banks,
he would miss many objects
once familiar to him, and
he would be conscious of
much change,&mdash;in many
ways for the better. Yet
there are the paths in
which he often trod; there
is the school in which he
was taught; there is the
garden of the mansion that he once owned, and in which he
died and there is the ancient church that enshrines his tomb.</p>

<p>The Birthplace, as it is now designated, is a two-story cottage made
of timber and plaster, with dormer windows in its sloping, attic roof. It
was originally a finer house than most of its neighbors. Its age is
unknown. John Shakespeare, William’s father, bought it in 1556 and
occupied it till his death, in 1601, when it became William’s property by
inheritance. By him it was bequeathed to his sister, Joan, Mrs. William
Hart. It has passed through many ownerships and has been materially
changed; but parts of it remain as originally they were, particularly the
room on the ground floor, in which there is a large fireplace, with seats
in the brick chimney jambs, and also the one immediately above it, the best
room in the house, in which, according to ancient tradition, the poet was
born. In that room there is a chair, of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class="caption">ROOM
IN WHICH,

TO
TRADITION,
SHAKESPEARE
WAS
BORN</p>

</div>

<p>The original window remains, a threefold casement, containing sixty
panes of glass, on which many visitors have scratched their names with
diamonds. No writing, on
window or walls, is permitted
now; but in earlier
times it was allowed, and
it was customary. Sir
Walter Scott scratched
his name on the window,&mdash;“W.
Scott.” Byron
wrote on the ceiling, which
is low, as also did Thackeray.
Byron’s name has
disappeared. Dickens
wrote on one of the walls.
The names of many actors,
including those of
Edmund Kean and Edwin
Booth, are inscribed on the chimney-jamb at the right of the fireplace.
Booth was specially requested to write his name there, “high up.” That
jamb is called “The Actors’ Pillar.”</p>

<p>The Birthplace was purchased for the nation in 1847&mdash;the American
museum and circus manager P. T. Barnum having alarmed England by
proposing to buy and remove it to America. New Place and Anne Hathaway’s
Cottage, at Shottery, about a mile west of Stratford, have since
then been purchased, and those properties are now administered as
a trust for the public.</p>

<p class="caption">The Mary Arden Cottage at Wilmcote, a little village near Stratford</p>

</div>

<p>New Place, the finest mansion in the town when Shakespeare bought
it, was destroyed in 1759 by order of Rev. Thomas Gastrell, its owner at
that time, who had been annoyed by many visitors, thronging to see his
house and to sit under
a mulberry tree in his
garden, believed to
have been planted and
reared by Shakespeare.
The tree was cut down
by Mr. Gastrell; but a
reputed “grandson” of
it is growing there now.
Nothing remains of the
building except its
foundation, long buried,
but later exhumed,
and now carefully preserved.
The house was
situated directly opposite
the Guild Chapel, a relic of the thirteenth century, and one of the
most venerable and pictorial of the towered churches of England.
Shakespeare hired two sittings in that church, and when he lived in New
Place he must have seen it almost continually. Next to the church is the
Grammar School, established in 1482, which there is every reason to
believe he attended in his boyhood. The building has been tastefully
“restored” to its original condition: the schoolroom has not been altered.</p>

<h3>ANNE HATHAWAY’S COTTAGE</h3>

<p class="caption">ANNE
HATHAWAY’S
COTTAGE,
SHOTTERY:
FROM THE
BROOK.</p>

</div>

<p>The Hathaway Cottage, to which the flower-bordered path is an
ancient “right of way,” through gardens and meadows that Shakespeare
must often have traversed, is an exceptionally fine specimen of the timber-crossed,
thatch-roofed dwelling of the Tudor period. It stands in a large
garden, is shaded by tall trees, and is prettily clad with woodbine, ivy,
wild roses, and maiden’s blush. In one of the upper chambers a large,
antique, carved four-post bedstead is shown, as having been used by
Anne Hathaway. It is possible that William and Anne lived in that
cottage immediately
after their marriage,
which occurred in 1582.
He was eighteen, she
was twenty-six. The
bond (a document required
in those days
to obtain authorization
of wedlock) is preserved
and may be inspected
in the Edgar Tower at
Worcester, where I saw
it in 1889. The actual
record of their marriage
is supposed to have
perished in a fire (before
1600) which, consuming
the church of
Ludington, a village
near Shottery, destroyed
the registers of
that parish.</p>

Cottage or the home
of his friends Hamnet
and Judith Sadler,
after whom his latest
born children, Hamnet
and Judith, twins, were
named. The Hathaway
Cottage seems
vitally associated with
him, as is still another
old timbered house, the
home of his mother, Mary Arden,
which may be seen on the outskirts
of the village of Wilmcote, situated
about four miles northwest of Stratford,&mdash;an
easy, pleasant walk.</p>

<h3>THE COUNTRY ROUND ABOUT</h3>

<p>Indeed, there is scarce an end to
the variety of pleasant walks feasible
in the Shakespeare Country, and I
have found it specially suggestive of
agreeable thoughts and feelings to
stroll in many directions and for
many miles around Stratford, and to
fancy the presence of Shakespeare
himself rambling, as probably his
custom was, over all the countryside.
How else could he have gained the
minute knowledge that is manifested
in his plays of Warwickshire names,
localities, characters, customs, and
the many peculiarities of foliage and
flower that distinguish the Warwickshire
clime? The “palm” that <i>Orlando</i>
finds in the Forest of Arden in “As You Like It” is not an oriental palm,
but a tree so named that grows now and has always grown on the banks
of the Avon. “Christopher Sly, of Burton Heath” and “Marian Hacket,
the fat ale-wife of Wincot” are types of Warwickshire peasantry, which
no doubt Shakespeare saw. Barton Heath and Wincot are places not
distant from his home.</p>

<p>To trace the course of Shakespeare from his birth to his death, is to
gain knowledge and wisdom. It is wisely written by the poet Tennyson
that “Things seen are mightier than things heard.”</p>

<p>The saying
goes in theatrical
circles that
Shakespeare
“doesn’t pay.”
And yet the editions
of Shakespeare
outnumber
those of
any other book
except the Bible,
and many new
editions appear
each season.
It seems then
that though we
read Shakespeare
we do not
go to see his
plays performed.
Apparently it
pays a publisher
to place Shakespeare
on the
shelf, but it does
not pay a producer
to place
him on the stage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="clear: right;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>I cannot accept
this statement
without qualification,
for I have
known years&mdash;not
far back&mdash;when Shakespeare was a
regular and profitable feature of the stage.
My knowledge of Shakespeare on the stage
began with Edwin Booth, Lawrence Barrett,
Henry Irving, John McCullough,
Salvini and the famous women, Modjeska,
Ellen Terry, and others who were their
associates in dramatic art. In recent years
I have listened to Mantell, Mansfield,
Sothern and Marlowe. I have seen some
of these players many times in their
favorite roles. I am sure that there are
few modern plays compelling enough
in interest to draw one to see them more
than a half dozen times. But it was a
common thing a few years ago to hear
people say that they had seen Booth or
Irving a dozen times in a single role.</p>

<p>In those days Shakespeare was played
not only with profit by the great stars,
but by stock-companies as well. Augustin
Daly, during
several successive,
and successful,
years
produced the
Comedies with
his strong company.
And these
were not gala
performances.
They were steady
going attractions.
In reckoning
stage successes
today, we consider
a run of
100 nights a matter
for celebration.
In his
time, Edwin
Booth played
“Hamlet” for
100 nights in
succession in one
New York theater,
and Irving
played “The
Merchant of
Venice” for the
greater part of
a whole season.
Runs of a single
play of Shakespeare
for several weeks were not uncommon.</p>

<p>But still they say today that Shakespeare
on the stage does not pay. That
means, of course, that we folks of today
do not go to hear Shakespeare. Why
don’t we go? We did when Booth, Barrett,
Irving and Salvini played. And if
Henry Irving should bring us today a production
of The Merchant of Venice such as
he made familiar to the theater-goers of
his time, Shakespeare would pay again.
If we do not go to hear Shakespeare played
it is because we want Shakespeare only
when it is produced and played <i>as well
as Shakespeare reads</i>. When a man of
genius and imagination gives us Shakespeare
as “big as we find him in his
plays,” we will surely go to hear him on
the stage today&mdash;as our parents did in former
days, and as we
did yesterday.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
